A Arduino project that is meant to serve as a motion
detector but also contains the feature of scaring 
someone.

To use, set up the mechanism as shown in the schematic
and then tape it to a wall. 

As soon as someone or something passes through this detector, 
it will play the song "Mary has a little lamb"

I used this to scare my roommate, and you can too!
