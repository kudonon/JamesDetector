A Arduino project that is meant to serve as a motion
detector but also contains the feature of responding 
to the detection.

The project uses an Arduino Uno, an UltraSound sensor,
and an active or passive buzzer. To use, set up the 
mechanism as shown in the schematic (PDF) and then tape it 
to a wall. As soon as someone or something passes 
through this detector,it will play the song "Mary 
has a little lamb"

I used this to scare my roommate, and you can too!
